#  A Safe "delete" Command  #
#############################
# Disable the rm command and define a safe "delete" command.
# The delete command forcefully moves all specified files to directory .trash.
# Directory .trash works exactly same as Ubuntu GUI's "Trash" and Windows "Trash".
#
# Caution: Empty the .trash directory every now and then.
# TODO:
#   Create a house-keeping function to delete all trash files more than 30 days old.
#   The house-keeping function might also monitor how large the trash directory is getting.
#   If too many files are being stored, perhaps some need to be deleted to free up disk space.

# Create a rm function that does nothing.
# This should help users keep out of mischief.
