// The General Form of a C++ Program, p.288

Although individual styles will differ, most C++ programs will have this general form:

#includes
base-class declarations
derived class declarations
nonmember function prototypes

int main()
{
  // ...
}

nonmember function definitions

In most large projects, all class declarations will be put into a header file and included with each module. But the general organization of a program remains the same.
