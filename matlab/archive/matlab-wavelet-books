5.0 out of 5 starsA Wavelet Tour
July 26, 2010
Format: HardcoverVerified Purchase
This is an advanced highly mathematical treatement of wavelets. Unlike Fourier transforms, wavelet decompositions of signals preserve both scale (the inverse of frequency) and position. The book presents an unusually thorough treatment of diverse practical wavelet applications. For readers familiar with MATLAB, all the examples in the book can be reproduced with MATLAB "workouts." The actively supported WAVELAB850 library containing the workouts and supporting utilities can be downloaded on the internet free. The author of the book Stephan Mallat was a key contributor to the development of wavelet theory. His style of presentation is demanding but worth the effort. The book is a nice complement to the more reader friendly text book "Wavelets and Filter Banks" by Gilbert Strang and truong Nguyen.

2.0 out of 5 starsNot for introduction to subject
July 12, 2010
Format: HardcoverVerified Purchase
I bought this book based on the author Mallat being a big name in the field of wavelets. I was trying to use it as self-study as an introduction to wavelets. The style of writing is like a stream of conscienceness. I'm guessing the book is meant as a reference for experts in the field. If you are looking for an introduction, this is not the book.

4.0 out of 5 starsPretty encyclopedic these days
September 3, 2009
Format: HardcoverVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )
Mallat's 800 page tome here is a very encyclopedic coverage of contemporary wavelet techniques and tricks. It takes the form of a "traditional" textbook: While there are some very brief refreshers on linear algebra, calculus, and statistics in an appendix, make no mistake -- there's a lot of advanced mathematics in the book, beyond what many (probably even the majority) of engineers learn during their undergraduate years. Additionally, while there are plenty of good "homework" problems at the end of each chapter, no solutions are provided. This all has several implications:

-- This isn't really the book you want for self-study if you aren't already familiar with wavelets. I'd suggest something like "A Primer on Wavelets and Their Scientific Applications" by Walker for that.
-- It can be a fine book for a college class on wavelets. I suspect the best approach would be for an instructor to use his own notes, assign reading for reinforcement, and problems from the end of each chapter. The deal here is that, in many cases, making good use of the results doesn't always require a full understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of the subject, and an instructor can guide students around what matters if they just want to apply the results (most students) vs. obtaining a deeper understanding that could be used to conduct new research or whatever (the very occasional student).
-- It is, of course, a fine reference for anyone already working in the field and familiar with the subject. Mallat is a pretty brilliant guy.

Note that Google Books has a copy of the earlier 2nd edition on-line; this might be handy for some people.

3.0 out of 5 starsAdvanced mathematics
May 29, 2011
Format: PaperbackVerified Purchase
This textbook has the advantage of being exceedingly thorough and detailed. This, unfortunately, is also its main drawback. Professional mathematicians will probably enjoy the extended derivations. Applied statisticians, engineers and programmers, however, may find this book to be rather long-winded, and too complex for context. As a mathematical treatise, this work is unsurpassed. However, it is definitely not a user-friendly programming manual.

4.0 out of 5 starsGreat book but poor typeface
October 21, 2015
Format: PaperbackVerified Purchase
This book is a very thorough and informative introduction. Note that it is written as a textbook for a course, with exercises. My only criticism is that the typeface is awful, and if you are reading it on paper, buy a magnifier or fresnel sheet or else you may get a headache from the cramped tiny type. That said, if you want to understand wavelets instead of just blindly using a package, this book is useful.

Took the course from Percival. The book is very scattered in its writing and the notations used is very loose so it takes a long time to fully understand the concepts if you purely base it from the text.

4.0 out of 5 starsintroduction to wavelets and its applications in time series
February 15, 2008
Format: Hardcover
The purpose of this text is to introduce wavelet methodology targeted toward applications in time series analysis. Emphasis is placed on the discrete wavelet transform and other discrete wavelets. There are many analogies to the spectral analysis of time series that the authors make. The authors do not assume knowledge of Fourier analysis and cover the relevent theory in Chapter 2. Just as the frequency domain methods decompose the variance of a time series into frequency components so to do wavelets decompose the variance according to scales. The authors take great pains in demonstrating this with several wavelets including the DWT and MODWT. Fast transform methods exist for wavelets as well as for Fourier series and they are apparently even simpler and faster for wavelets.
The text tries to be self-contained and the authors start out at a very elementary level. They emphasize applications and practical aspects of wavelets.

5.0 out of 5 starsReference for time series analysts using wavelets
December 17, 2002
Format: Hardcover
Few wavelet books offer such a deep insight into wavelet methods
for time series analysts. It goes very deep within the applied
side of wavelet analysis on real time series while not compromising
the mathematical side. A lot of books and papers insist too much
on the mathematical side of wavelets while this one provides just
the right balance between rigor and practical insight. If your
interest does not lie in maths but just in wavelets as a tool,
stick to this one.
As a bonus, it contains a lot of exercices along with answers
at the end of the book...a very good textbook indeed...

2.0 out of 5 starsFull of embarrassing mathematical errors
January 19, 2014
Format: Paperback
I'm only on page 22, and already I have a long laundry list of mathematical errors.

The author can't decide on a notation for vectors in R^n. Are they row vectors? Column vectors? Do we use brackets or parentheses? Just pick one, for crying out loud.

Another example: "Hilbert spaces generalize the familiar Euclidean three-dimensional space R^3.... For instance, an orthogonal projection from the tip of a standard three dimensional vector onto an arbitrary plane through the origin has its analog in Hilbert spaces in the form of an orthogonal projection onto a linear subspace...." First of all, what the heck is the "tip" of a vector and how to you project from it? And what is the definition of projection of a vector onto a plane in R^3 if not exactly the definition given as the "analog" in Hilbert spaces?

The book gives a definition for a bounded linear operator, then inexplicably gives a different (though equivalent) definition for a bounded linear functional, which is a type of linear operator. Why not use the same definition that was already given? Why confuse matters by giving extra definitions for special cases when the original definition works just as well? To top it off, on the very next page we are given yet a third definition, this time for what it means for the point evaluation functional to be bounded. At this point the reader now has three (!!) definitions for a bounded point evaluation functional. I just don't even...

The author states that the integral notation will always refer to the Lebesgue integral but then uses the integral notation for inner product of distributions at the first possible chance without any explanation. This notation is actually standard, but it's nonsense without explanation, particularly when the text explicitly states that the notation means something different.

While many of my complaints above are arguably aesthetic, there are several serious mathematical problems with the text. Theorems are stated without proof, which may be fine for such a text, but some of the supplied proofs are a complete mess. One proof of an equivalence omits one of the directions. The author seems to not understand L_2 equivalence classes of functions. The most disturbing mathematical defect is the author's use of the word basis. Apparently the author does not know what a basis is, which is inexcusable given the subject. For example, the author states (incorrectly) that the complex exponentials are a basis (!!) for L_2(R). In fact, the complex exponentials are clearly not even members of L_2(R). (The difference between Schauder and Hamel bases is not mentioned.) These errors are embarrassing.

I think the reason I am so frustrated by these deficiencies is that the text would otherwise be fantastic. It would have been SO EASY for the author to have gotten these things right, and if he had, he would have written a beautiful text.

The book has simplified for me several DSP and wavelet theory concepts that I had previously considered intricate. It certainly met my expectations. I recommend it as a first course in DWT.

one of very few books on the subject that has this excellent pedagogical approach.
the wavelets are also introduced without painful mathematics, very well done.
compine this book with DSP primer from Ken steiglitz and you will be solidly founded.
highly recommended for any body seeks to learn DSP basics with matlab.

If you know something about MATLAB and DSP, you will not learn anything from this book.
It is very elementary. The title should be have been "DSP using MATLAB for dummies"!
It is only useful for the people who are just beginning to learn MATLAB/DSP
